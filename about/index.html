	<p>Revolutionary new technologies, and
	especially media technologies, simultaneously possess an
	empancipatory as well as oppressive potentiality. The Yippies,
	for example, saw television as an exciting medium to subvert hegemony;
	the '60s radicals were tantalised by the idea of hijacking mass media, using it as a tool for liberation. Of course -- as theorists were well aware -- these items have become some of the sharpest
	instruments of control.</p>
	<p>The internet is the greatest media technology so far. In light of that,
	this web site is currently kept "back to basics" because its goal isn't to sell you ad-space or waste your time with bloat: decentralised publishing is the secret origin of today's zombie-net.</p>
